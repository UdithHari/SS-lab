ALGORITHM:
1. Set Sl-register as pointer for array.
2. Set CL-register as count for N-1 repetitions.
3. Initialize array pointer.
4. Set CH as count for N-1 comparison.
5. Increment the array pointer.
6. Get an element of array in AL-register.
7. Increment the array pointer.
8. Compare the next element of the array with AL.
9. Check carry flag. If carry flag is set then go to step 12, otherwise go to next step.
10. Exchange the content of memory pointed by SI and the content of previous memory location. (For this, exchange
AL and memory pointed by SI, and then exchange AL and memory pointed by SI-1.)
11. Decrement the count for comparisons (CH-register).
12. Check zero flag. If zero flag is reset then go to step 6, otherwise go to next step.
13. Decrement the count for repetitions (CL-register).
14. Check zero flag. If zero flag is reset then go to step 3, otherwise go to next step.
15. Stop
